I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at [NYU Courant](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), advised by [Prof. Michael Walfish](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/). 


Prior to that, I received my B.Eng (2021) and M.Eng (2024) degree with honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I worked at the [NSEC Lab](https://nsec.sjtu.edu.cn/) led by [Prof. Haojin Zhu](https://nsec.sjtu.edu.cn/~hjzhu/). 


I also spent some time interning at Purdue University (2023, hosted by Prof. [Z. Berkay Celik](https://beerkay.github.io/)) and IMDEA Software (2024, hosted by [Prof. Juan Caballero](https://software.imdea.org/~juanca/) and mentored by [Dr. Srdjan Matic](https://software.imdea.org/people/srdjan.matic/)).


My current research explores confidential computing and verifiable computing, including approaches with and without trusted hardwares. In addition, I am quite interested in privacy issues within VR/AR/XR environments and the advertising ecosystem, as well as the safety challenges in cyber-physical systems (CPS).
